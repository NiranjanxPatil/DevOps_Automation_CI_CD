# **DevOps Journey: Building a CI/CD Pipeline and Full-Stack Development Setup**

## **Project Overview**

**🚀 From Code to Cloud: Building Scalable Applications with a Fully Automated CI/CD Pipeline**  

Imagine writing code, hitting "push," and having your application deployed and live on the internet without lifting another finger. That’s exactly what this project achieves! By fusing cutting-edge tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, this pipeline takes the pain out of deployment while ensuring scalability, reliability, and ease of access.

### **🔧 How It Works: A Seamless DevOps Symphony**  

#### **1. Developers Create, the Pipeline Executes**  
- **The Start of the Journey**: Developers push their code to a **GitHub repository**, where the magic begins.  
   - **Where to get GitHub**: You can set up a GitHub repository by signing up on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).  
   - **Setup**: Create a new repository, push your local project to the cloud using Git, and configure webhook integration with Jenkins.  
- **Jenkins Watches the Repository**: With **SCM polling**, Jenkins springs into action every time a new commit is made, triggering the pipeline.  
   - **Where to get Jenkins**: Download and install Jenkins from [Jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/).  
   - **Setup**: Follow the setup guide to configure your Jenkins server and connect it with GitHub using Jenkins GitHub plugin.

---

#### **2. Continuous Integration: Turning Ideas into Artifacts**  
- **Building with Maven**: Jenkins compiles the code using **Maven**, generating a slick **WAR file** ready for deployment.  
   - **Where to get Maven**: Install Maven from the [Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/).  
   - **Setup**: Add Maven to Jenkins as a tool under "Global Tool Configuration" and link it to your project for automatic builds.  
- **Dockerized Perfection**:  
  - The WAR file is handed to **Ansible**, which creates a custom **Docker image** with a pre-configured **Tomcat server**.  
   - **Where to get Docker**: Download Docker from [Docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).  
   - **Setup**: Install Docker on your machine, and set up a Dockerfile in your project to automate containerization.  
  - The image, containing the application, is pushed to **DockerHub**, making it globally accessible.  
   - **Where to get DockerHub**: Create a DockerHub account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).  
   - **Setup**: Log in to your DockerHub account through the terminal and push your Docker image for storage and access.  

> 💡 *Every step is automated, leaving no room for human error.*

#### **3. Continuous Deployment: Bringing Applications to Life**  
- **Enter Kubernetes**:  
  - Ansible takes over again, orchestrating Kubernetes deployments using **manifests**.  
   - **Where to get Kubernetes**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster using [Kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/).  
   - **Setup**: Install `kubectl` and configure a Kubernetes cluster (using services like AWS EKS or local Kubernetes setups like Minikube).  
  - **Pods** are spun up to host the containers, and a **Load Balancer** ensures the traffic is evenly distributed.  
   - **Where to get Load Balancer**: AWS provides an in-built Load Balancer service. Alternatively, Kubernetes also has an internal load balancing mechanism with services of type `LoadBalancer`.  
- **High Availability**:  
  - The Kubernetes cluster includes **auto-healing nodes** that recover from failures without human intervention.  
  - With **Elastic IPs** and **AWS Route 53**, the application is globally accessible via a custom domain.  
   - **Where to get AWS**: Sign up for AWS services [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).  
   - **Setup**: Configure Elastic IPs and Route 53 in AWS to point to your Kubernetes service for global accessibility.
